<p>Persistence is a means of storing data beyond the execution of a program, in such a way that the data can be reproduced, in memory, at a later time.</p>
<p>The BaH.Persistence module attempts to do this through the use of reflection and xml.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The most simple usage is to pass an object into TPersist.Serialize(), which returns the serialized representation of it as a String.
</p>
<p>
To reverse the process, the serialized String can be passed into TPersist.DeSerialize(), returning a new Object instance, which is essentially a "deep"
copy of the original object.
</p>
<p>
There are also methods, SerializeToFile(), SerializeToDoc(), and SerializeToStream() which output to different formats apporpriately.
</p>
<p>
The DeSerialize() function itself can take a TxmlDoc, TStream or String data as a parameter, as well as there being the specialised methods of
DeSerializeFromDoc(), DeSerializeFromFile(), and DeSerializeFromStream().
